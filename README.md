# Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction
We have used various machine learning models like linear regression, ridge regression, KNN, random forest, decision tree and XG Boost regressor. The main advantage of this project is that we can use these models to check other sales prediction situations in the future.


Black Friday is also known as Thanksgiving Day in the United States. Every year on the fourth Thursday of November, this sale is held. In terms of shopping, this is the busiest day of the year.The goal of holding this offer is to encourage people to purchase more things. This season is crucial for the economy because around 30 percent of annual retail sales occur during the holiday season. For some retailers, such as jewelers, it is even higher, at almost 40 percent.
These shops are struggling to please their customers because they don’t have a good understanding of who they are and the needs of the consumer. As a result, prediction
models are required for a better understanding of the situation and to recognize the preferences of the customers. Prediction using the machine learning techniques can help in improving the overall sales and also produce profit. Machine learning models can be used to train the data and then they can beused to predict the future results. The prediction model built will help to analyze the relationship among various attributes. Ample research is carried out on the analysis and prediction of sales using various techniques. There are many methods proposed to do so by various researchers. We have used various machine learning models like linear regression, ridge regression, KNN, random forest, decision tree and XG Boost regressor. The main advantage of this project is that we can use these models to check other sales prediction situations in the future.
